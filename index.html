            You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike.
                <br> <br>
            If you’re a beginner, choose a flat bike path or road. If you’re ready for a tougher workout that also engages your upper body and core, try mountain biking. It’s also called off-road biking. You can do it on trails and different types of rough terrain.
            <br> <br>
            Mountain biking is trickier because you have to navigate hills and surfaces, so your upper body and core will kick into gear. It’s more of a total-body workout than biking on the road, which is mostly a lower-body cardio workout.

            Plan to get on your bike and ride for 30-60 minutes, 3-5 days a week.
            <br> <br>
            Start every ride with a warm-up. Pedal at a slow, easy pace for 5-10 minutes. Then boost your speed so you start to sweat. If you’re riding a stationary bike, simply change the settings for a faster pace.

            When you’re ready to wrap things up, take an extra 5 minutes to cool down by cycling at a slower pace.
            <br> <br>
            Intensity Level: High
            Cycling gets your heart rate up almost as much as running and burns a lot of calories. It's also gentle on your body. It doesn't put a lot of stress on your joints, which helps if you’re getting into shape or have joint problems.
